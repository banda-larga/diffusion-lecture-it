[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/banda-larga/diffusion-lecture-it/blob/main/diffusion.ipynb)

## Overview

This repository contains a presentation on **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models** (`DDPMs`) at the University of Insubria. 
The presentation is written in `Italian` and provides an introduction to **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models** (`DDPMs`), followed by a hands-on implementation from scratch, using the ðŸ¤— Diffusers library and playing with stable diffusion.
